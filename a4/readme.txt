Run the python files with numpy, cv2, and matplotlib installed. The first part is a4p1.py (located in Part1) and the
second part is a4p2.py (located in Part2). The python files should be run from the same directory as they are currently
in. Each part allows you to toggle which questions are run under the if __name__ == '__main__':, for example by setting
test_q4 = True. By default, all questions are run, but questions can be run independently of each other.

For Q1 and Q3, the point cloud and videos for each image is located in its folder.

For Part 2, the matches used are stored in matches.txt for each pair of images. Each line in matches.txt is in the
format 'x_l y_l x_r y_r'.
